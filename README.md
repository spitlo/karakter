# Karakter

Add a little flair to your text by substituting visually similar characters from the greek or cyrillic alphabet for your ordinary a-z and A-Z characters. Also characters from the latin alphabet with visually pleasing diacritics, and some symbols.

All characters are chosen from [this list](https://github.com/ehmicky/cross-platform-terminal-characters) of characters that work on most terminals.

At the moment, this is a bash script. My ~~plan was~~ hope is to re-write it in a few different languages that I’ve been wanting to try out.

## Examples

### Input text

```txt
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
```

### Output text, obfuscation level low
