All characters are chosen from [this list](https://github.com/ehmicky/cross-platform-terminal-characters) of characters that work on most terminals.

At the moment, this is a bash script. My ~~plan was~~ hope is to re-write it in a few different languages that I’ve been wanting to try out.

## Options

### ~~Obfuscation level~~ Character

You can change the level of obfuscation by supplying the arguments `--lo`, `--md`, or `--hi`. This will affect the amount of characters changed.

### Style

If you’re not happy with the default style, you can supply arguments `--cp` or `--ft`, for a more `¢џБ≡┎pμ∩κ` or `ƒάїгψłάľє` look, respectively.

## Usage examples

Highly obfuscate text from a file on your filesystem:

```bash
cat a_tale_of_two_cities.txt | bash/karakter --hi
```

Generate a mildly elvish version of your name for an email signature:

```bash
bash/karakter --md --ft John Doe
```

Turn A Tale of Two Cities into a cyberpunk novel:

```bash
cat a_tale_of_two_cities.txt | tr [a-z] [A-Z] | bash/karakter --hi --cp
```

## Output examples

### Input text

```txt
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
```

### Output text, obfuscation level low

```txt

### Output text, obfuscation level medium
