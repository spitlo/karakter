# Karakter (Nim version)

## Building

To build the `karakter` binary, you need to install [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/install.html). Then run:

```bash
cd nim && nimble build karakter && cd ..
```

If you donâ€™t want to bother with remembering individual build commands, just run `bin/build nim` from the root folder.

Any of these methods create a binary executable in the `nim` directory. You can run the command with `nim/karakter`.
